# beefy-v2
Official frontend repo of Beefy, The Multichain Yield Optimizer - [app.beefy.com](https://app.beefy.com)

## Quickstart

`yarn start` - start the app in development mode - you may have to disable adblock for 127.0.0.1 if you get a white screen due to ADX.png

`yarn tsc-watch` - checks types as you develop - you may not need this if your IDE does it for you

`yarn validate` - validates vault config files

`yarn build-only` - checks types and builds the app for production

`yarn build` - performs validate then build

`yarn preview` - start the app in production mode (after building)

Please ensure `yarn build` completes successfully before submitting a PR.
