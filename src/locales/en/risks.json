  "Complexity-Low-Expl": "Low-complexity strategies have few, if any, moving parts and their code is easy to read and debug. There is a direct correlation between code complexity and inherent risk. A simple strategy effectively mitigates implementation risks.",
  "Complexity-Low-Cond": "A low-complexity strategy interacts with just one audited and well-known smart contract, e.g. 'MasterChef.' The strategy serves as a façade for this smart contract, forwarding a deposit(), harvest() or withdrawal() call with a single corresponding line of code.",
  "Complexity-Mid-Titl": "Medium-complexity strategy",
  "Complexity-Mid-Expl": "A medium-complexity strategy interacts with two or more audited and well-known smart contracts. Its code is still easy to read, test and debug. It mitigates most implementation risks by keeping things simple, however the interactions between two or more systems add a layer of complexity.",
  "Complexity-Mid-Cond": "A medium complexity strategy interacts with two or more well-known smart contracts. Such a strategy automates the execution of a series of steps with no forking paths. Each time deposit(), harvest() or withdraw() is called, the same corresponding execution path is followed.",
  "Complexity-Hi-Titl": "High-complexity strategy",
  "Complexity-Hi-Expl": "A High-complexity strategy interacts with one or more well-known smart contracts. Such a strategy presents branching paths of execution. In some cases multiple smart contracts are required to implement the strategy.",
  "Complexity-Hi-Cond": "A high-complexity strategy can be identified by one or more of the following factors: high cyclomatic complexity, interactions between two or more third-party platforms, implementation split between multiple smart contracts.",

  "IL-None-Expl": "The asset in this vault has very little, or no, expected divergence (impermanent) loss (IL). IL plays no role if only a single asset has been staked, and only a small role if the staked assets are very tightly and positively correlated, like with USDC-USDT or WBTC-renBTC.",

  "IL-Low-Titl": "Low expected IL",
  "IL-Low-Expl": "When you provide liquidity for a token pair, like ETH-BNB, the two assets usually diverge in price over time to some extent. BNB might drop 10% while ETH rises 10%. Even in this balanced case, value would be lost compared with having held ETH and BNB on their own. The assets in this vault involve such normal risk of divergence (impermanent) loss (IL).",

Even in this balanced case, value would be lost compared with having held ETH and BNB on their own. At least one of the tokens involved in this vault is an algorithmic stablecoin whose 'stable' peg is experimental. This brings polarized risk of divergence (impermanent) loss (IL), meaning the risk is either low, like with standard stablecoin LPs, or very high since if the peg is lost, the unpegged token can quickly become worthless along with any LP involving it. Thus this vault is to be considered high-risk and used only carefully, with discretion.",

  "StrategyDescription-lending": "Speaking generally, a lending protocol is a decentralized marketplace for lenders and borrowers. When a user deposits {{depositToken}} into this vault, Beefy moves it into the protocol, then borrows against the position at a safe level of collateral (i.e. loan of less than 100%). The borrowed {{depositToken}} is then redeposited into the same protocol, and this procedure is repeated multiple times in order to maximize interest earned, earnings which are used to acquire more {{depositToken}}. Note that this 'leveraged' multi-lending and -borrowing involves only {{depositToken}}; therefore price swings present no liquidation risk.\n\nNOTES\n+ Transaction Fees: Owing to the multi-supply/borrow cycle, transaction fees with the vault tends to run 4x higher than with standard vaults.\n+ Accrual Pattern: Because of accrued interest on borrowings, the user may notice a slight decline in their {{depositToken}} holdings between harvests. Yet at each harvest event, the amount stairsteps beyond as the compounded yield adds in.\n+ Marketability Risk: When {{depositToken}} on the lending platform becomes overborrowed, it can prevent the vault's strategy from deleveraging (unfolding) to accommodate a withdrawal. This usually happens when the market is volatile, or when there is an ongoing event for which people want to borrow funds. The overborrowed condition will naturally resolve once liquidity returns to the lending platform, a process which can take hours or, sometimes, a few days. Meanwhile, vaulted funds remain safe.",
